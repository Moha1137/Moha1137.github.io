                Hello! My name is Abdi, and I am currently enrolled in the 
                <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College. 
                I came to Canada back in 2012 from Somalia, so I have been here in Canada for a while now. 
                I have a few hobbies, but one of them is playing video games on my PC. 
                I used to have a PS5, but I sold it to upgrade to a gaming PC that I built myself. 
                It was the best decision I made back in September 2024.
            </p>
            <h3>My Hobbies:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Gaming is one of my hobbies!</li>
                <li>Shopping is my second hobby. I love shopping.</li>
            </ul>
